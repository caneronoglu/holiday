Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Object to processing<\/b>\u00a0of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.

This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
