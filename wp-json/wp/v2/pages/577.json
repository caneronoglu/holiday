As our properties are located in England, you and we agree that the laws of England will govern our contract with you (the \u201ccontract\u201d). If any individual term or clause stated in these terms and conditions held to be invalid, impermissible or unenforceable permissible by law, the remaining terms shall be unaffected and shall remain valid.\r\nThe contract will not come into force until we have received the deposit referred to in clause 2 below. The contract will be subject to these booking terms and conditions, and must be complied with. The party leader must be at least 18 years of age at the time of booking and prior to arrival we must have full contact details of the party leader.<\/p>\r\n<h4>2. Deposit and Payment<\/h4>\r\n<p>Your booking (\u201cbooking\u201d) may be placed over the telephone, by email or directly on our online reservation system. Where your booking is communicated to us by telephone or by email, we will enter it onto our online reservation system, which will automatically generate a summary by email to the email address you provide in the online booking form. However, that does not mean that your booking is yet confirmed or that a contract is yet in force between us and you.<\/p>\r\n<p>Your booking will only be confirmed and our contract will only come into force once we have received payment in cleared funds of a deposit of\u00a0thirty (30%)\u00a0of the full cost of your booking (the \u201cdeposit\u201d).<\/p>\r\n<p>The deposit must be paid within 24 hours (1) days of the booking being placed.\r\nThe balance of the rental will be due for payment 8 weeks prior to your holiday commencement date (the \u201choliday commencement date\u201d).<\/p>\r\n<p>If you paid the deposit by credit or debit card, you authorise us to use the details of the same credit or debit card to settle the balance of the rental. we will only act on this authority if you have not contacted us prior to the balance due date to arrange alternative payment of the balance.<\/p>\r\n<p>If for any reason we are unable to take payment of the balance by the due date and you are unable to promptly rearrange payment (or we cannot get hold of you to arrange for payment to be made) we will be entitled to treat that as your intention to cancel the booking. If your booking is made less than 8 weeks prior to the holiday commencement date then your booking will only be confirmed and our contract will only come into force once we have received payment in full for the booking in cleared funds.<\/p>\r\n<p>No entry to our properties will be allowed without payment, in full, being cleared beforehand.<\/p>\r\n<p>We accept payment by most major credit or debit cards and by bank transfer.<\/p>\r\n<h4>3.
